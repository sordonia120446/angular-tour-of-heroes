Notes on Angular 2.0 Tour of Heroes Guide:  

Language (scripts) = Typescript (type-safe JS)

-Our Tour of Heroes uses the double curly braces of interpolation (a kind of one-way data binding) to display the application title and properties of a Hero object.
-We wrote a multi-line template using ES2015’s template strings to make our template readable.
-We can both display and change the hero’s name after adding a two-way data binding to the <input> element using the built-in ngModel directive.
-The ngModel directive also propagates changes to every other binding of the hero.name.


The (*) prefix to ngFor indicates that the <li> element and its children constitute a master template.

When there is no selectedHero, the ngIf directive removes the hero detail HTML from the DOM. There will be no hero detail elements and no bindings to worry about.

Naming conventions
We like to identify at a glance which classes are components and which files contain components.

Notice that we have an AppComponent in a file named app.component.ts and our new HeroDetailComponent is in a file named hero-detail.component.ts.

All of our component names end in "Component". All of our component file names end in ".component".

We spell our file names in lower dash case (AKA kebab-case) so we don't worry about case sensitivity on the server or in source control.
