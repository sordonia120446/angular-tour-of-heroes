Notes on Angular 2.0 Tour of Heroes Guide:  

Language (scripts) = Typescript (type-safe JS)

-Our Tour of Heroes uses the double curly braces of interpolation (a kind of one-way data binding) to display the application title and properties of a Hero object.
-We wrote a multi-line template using ES2015’s template strings to make our template readable.
-We can both display and change the hero’s name after adding a two-way data binding to the <input> element using the built-in ngModel directive.
-The ngModel directive also propagates changes to every other binding of the hero.name.


The (*) prefix to ngFor indicates that the <li> element and its children constitute a master template.

When there is no selectedHero, the ngIf directive removes the hero detail HTML from the DOM. There will be no hero detail elements and no bindings to worry about.
